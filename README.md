# Machine-Learning-for-performance-prediction-of-Spark-Cloud-Application
Through this project, the cost benefits of using supervised Machine Learning models in performance prediction of Spark applications is investigated. More specifically, a set of features are extracted from target Spark applications and a platform configuration, then, the purpose is to design models that produce accurate estimations of execution time
