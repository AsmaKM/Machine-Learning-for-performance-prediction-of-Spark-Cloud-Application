# Machine-Learning-for-performance-prediction-of-Spark-Cloud-Application
Through this project, the cost benefits of using supervised Machine Learning models in performance prediction of Spark applications is investigated. More specifically, a set of features are extracted from target Spark applications and a platform configuration, then, the purpose is to design models that produce accurate estimations of execution time. In other words, the project is aimed to investigate and evaluate the predictions accuracy by exploiting other regression algorithms and/or other features.

Four classical machine learning techniques are considered and two different methods are built to make the predictions. The four ML techniques used are linear regression (LR), neural network (NN), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF). In addition, each model is run both as a black box and as a white/gray box. Black box methods are similar to the Ernest model and make predictions by using the features that capture knowledge available prior to the execution of the applications. The gray box method uses more features capturing more details of the application execution.
